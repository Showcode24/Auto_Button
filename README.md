DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
DRY is a software development principle that promotes the idea of reducing redundancy in code. The main concept is to avoid duplicating code by creating reusable components or functions. 

YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):
YAGNI is a principle that advises against implementing features or functionalities until they are actually needed. It suggests that developers should avoid adding speculative features that may not be necessary for the current requirements. 

SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of five design principles aimed at creating maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility. This principle encourages a class to be focused on a single task.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This encourages the use of interfaces or abstract classes, allowing new functionality to be added without altering existing code.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. This principle suggests breaking interfaces into smaller, more specific ones to avoid unnecessary dependencies.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes the use of dependency injection and inversion of control.







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
